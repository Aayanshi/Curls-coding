'''The power of an integer x is defined as the number of steps needed to transform
x into 1 using the following steps:
● if x is even then x = x / 2
● if x is odd then x = 3 * x + 1
For example, the power of x = 3 is 7 because 3 needs 7 steps to become 1 (3 -->
10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1).
